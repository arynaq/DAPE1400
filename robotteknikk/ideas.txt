#Immediate Mode

	# Datapoints are added with (x,y) points to this class
	# Datapoints 



#PROBLEMS


	# In immediatemode the TCP controller must send data not asap but in bursts of datapoints
	# The TCP controller must be threaded

		# Problem: The superclass TCP controller has a send method that gives 0 shits about bursts 

		# Solution:

			ImmediateMode implements a task that runs periodically

			Problem:
				Ugly, but there are dependency issues here...
